## Abstract

WTX-1 (WaiTag Transfer Protocol, version 1) defines a method for preserving pseudonymous user context across unrelated web domains without third-party cookies, browser fingerprinting, login requirements, or personal data collection. The protocol uses cryptographically generated pseudonymous identifiers (WaiTags), URL hash fragment transport, server-side verification, and DNS-based domain authorization to enable privacy-respecting cross-domain analytics.

---

## 1. Problem Statement

### 1.1 The Third-Party Cookie Sunset

Third-party cookies have been the primary mechanism for cross-domain user identification since the 1990s. With Safari ITP (2017), Firefox ETP (2019), and Chrome's Privacy Sandbox (2024+), this mechanism is being eliminated across all major browsers.

### 1.2 What Breaks

When a user navigates from `hospital-a.com` to `pharmacy-b.com`, or from `bank.com` to `investment-portal.com`, analytics systems lose the ability to understand that the same visitor made both visits. This creates blind spots in:

- Patient journey analytics across healthcare providers
- Financial customer experience across banking portals
- Government service usage across agency domains
- Multi-brand retail analytics

### 1.3 Existing Solutions and Their Limitations

| Solution | Limitation |
|----------|-----------|
| Third-party cookies | Being eliminated by all major browsers |
| Browser fingerprinting | Ethically problematic, increasingly blocked, legally risky |
| Login-based identity | Requires authentication; excludes anonymous visitors |
| First-party data sharing | Requires business partnerships and PII exchange |
| Privacy Sandbox Topics API | Coarse-grained, advertising-focused, Chrome-only |
| Adobe ECID | Same eTLD+1 only, classified as personal data under GDPR |

### 1.4 Design Goals

WTX-1 is designed to:

1. Preserve visitor context across unrelated domains (different eTLD+1)
2. Never collect, transmit, or derive personal information
3. Work without third-party cookies, fingerprinting, or login (first-party cookies are used only for local identity persistence, not for cross-domain token transport)
4. Resist tracking by unauthorized third parties
5. Degrade gracefully when consent is denied
6. Operate within GDPR, CCPA, and ePrivacy frameworks

---

## 2. Terminology

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **WaiTag** | A pseudonymous identifier generated per-visitor using cryptographic randomness. Format: `wai_<timestamp_b36>_<random><domain_hash>`. Contains no PII. |
| **Origin Domain** | The domain where the user's session begins and the WaiTag is generated. |
| **Destination Domain** | The domain the user navigates to, which receives and verifies the WaiTag. |
| **Cross-Domain Token** | A time-limited, server-signed token encoding the WaiTag for transfer between domains. |
| **DNS Authorization** | Domain ownership verification via DNS TXT records that authorizes a domain to participate in WTX-1 identity sharing. |
| **Verification Server** | The server-side component that issues, signs, and verifies cross-domain tokens. |
| **Anonymous Mode** | A degraded operating mode where no WaiTag is generated and no identity is preserved. |
| **Early-Cleanup Script** | An inline `<head>` script that strips tokens from the URL before any other scripts execute, minimizing the token visibility window. |

```

### 3.2 Step-by-Step

1. **WaiTag Generation** — When a user first visits a participating domain, the SDK generates a WaiTag using the Web Crypto API (`crypto.getRandomValues`). The WaiTag format is `wai_<timestamp_base36>_<random_id><domain_hash>`.

2. **Identity Registration** — The SDK registers the WaiTag with the verification server via `POST /api/tracking/register-waitag`. The server stores the WaiTag, session ID, originating domain, and timestamp.

3. **Cross-Domain Navigation** — When the user navigates to another participating domain, a cross-domain token must be appended to the destination URL. The mechanism for link decoration is implementation-defined (e.g., server-side link rewriting, client-side click handlers, or manual URL construction).

4. **Token Generation** — The server generates a signed, time-limited token encoding the user's WaiTag and session context. The server SHOULD verify that the destination domain is DNS-authorized before issuing the token.

5. **Hash Fragment Transport** — The token is appended to the destination URL as a hash fragment (`#nylo_token=<token>`). Hash fragments are never sent to the server in HTTP requests, providing an additional privacy layer.

6. **Early Cleanup** — On the destination domain, an inline `<head>` script executes before any other scripts, reads the token from the hash fragment, stashes it in a short-lived JavaScript variable (`window.__nylo_early_token`), and immediately cleans the URL using `history.replaceState()`. This ensures the token is never visible to third-party page scripts.

7. **Token Verification** — The SDK reads the token from the stashed variable (or from the hash fragment as fallback if the early-cleanup script is not deployed), and sends it to the verification server via `POST /api/tracking/verify-cross-domain-token`.

8. **Identity Restoration** — If verification succeeds (signature valid, not expired, domain authorized, not previously used), the server returns the original WaiTag and session context. The SDK restores the user's pseudonymous identity on the new domain.

## 4. WaiTag Format

### 4.1 Structure

```
wai_<random>_<domain_hash>
```

| Component | Encoding | Length | Source |
|-----------|----------|--------|--------|
| Prefix | ASCII | 4 chars | Literal `wai_` |
| Random ID | Base-36 | 19 chars | `crypto.getRandomValues(new Uint8Array(16))`, encoded to base-36 and truncated |
| Separator | ASCII | 1 char | Literal `_` |
| Domain Hash | Hex | up to 8 chars | One-way hash of `window.location.hostname` |

The random component provides 128 bits of cryptographic entropy (16 bytes from the Web Crypto API), encoded in base-36 for compactness.

### 4.2 Example

```
wai_0g0e161m0a0i0r0b0h0_1a2b3c4d
```

### 4.3 Properties

- **Not reversible** — No component can be reversed to identify a person
- **Not derived from PII** — No personal information is used as input
- **Domain-scoped** — The domain hash binds the WaiTag to its origin, but the hash is one-way and cannot reveal the domain to a third party
- **Collision-resistant** — 64 bits of cryptographic randomness provides sufficient uniqueness for analytics use cases

### 4.4 What a WaiTag is NOT

- It is not a fingerprint (no hardware/software signals are used)
- It is not a cookie (it does not use the `Set-Cookie` / `Cookie` HTTP mechanism for cross-domain transfer; a first-party cookie is used only as a local storage fallback)
- It is not PII (it cannot identify a natural person)
- It is not deterministic (the same user on the same device will get different WaiTags across sessions unless identity is restored)

---

## 5. Token Transport

### 5.1 Primary: URL Hash Fragment

The cross-domain token MUST be transported via URL hash fragment:

```
https://destination.com/page#nylo_token=<signed_token>
```

**Rationale:** Hash fragments (the portion of a URL after `#`) are processed entirely client-side. Per [RFC 3986 §3.5](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3986#section-3.5), they are:

- Never included in HTTP requests to the server
- Never logged in server access logs
- Never sent in the `Referer` header
- Not visible to network intermediaries (proxies, CDNs, WAFs)

This provides a stronger privacy guarantee than URL search parameters (`?key=value`), which are transmitted to the server and commonly logged.

### 5.2 Early-Cleanup Script

To minimize the token visibility window, implementations SHOULD deploy an inline early-cleanup script in the `<head>` of every destination page. This script MUST execute before any other scripts (including third-party analytics, tag managers, and ad scripts).

**Behavior:**

1. The script reads the URL hash fragment
2. If a `nylo_token` or `wai_token` parameter is present, the script extracts the token value
3. The token is stored in a short-lived JavaScript variable (`window.__nylo_early_token`)
4. The token is immediately removed from the URL using `history.replaceState()`
5. Any remaining non-token hash parameters are preserved

**Reference implementation:**

```html
<script>
(function(){
  try{
    var h=window.location.hash;
    if(h&&(h.indexOf("nylo_token=")>-1||h.indexOf("wai_token=")>-1)){
      var p=new URLSearchParams(h.substring(1));
      var t=p.get("nylo_token")||p.get("wai_token");
      if(t){
        window.__nylo_early_token=t;
        p.delete("nylo_token");p.delete("wai_token");
        var n=p.toString();
        history.replaceState(null,"",
          window.location.pathname+window.location.search+(n?"#"+n:""));
      }
    }
  }catch(e){}
})();
</script>
```

**Placement requirements:**

- MUST be placed inline in the `<head>` element
- MUST appear before any `<script src="...">` tags (including analytics, tag managers, and the Nylo SDK itself)
- MUST NOT be loaded asynchronously or deferred
- SHOULD be the first `<script>` element in the document

**Why this matters:**

Without the early-cleanup script, the token remains in the URL hash from the moment the page starts loading until the Nylo SDK initializes and cleans it. During this window, any JavaScript on the page — including third-party scripts — can read `window.location.hash` and see the token. The early-cleanup script removes the token from the URL before other scripts execute.

**Important caveat:** The early-cleanup script stashes the token in `window.__nylo_early_token`, which is a globally accessible JavaScript variable. Any script that runs after the early-cleanup script and knows this variable name can read the token. This is a deliberate trade-off: the token must be stored somewhere between early-cleanup and SDK initialization. However, this is significantly more secure than leaving the token in the URL hash because:

1. `window.location.hash` is a well-known, commonly inspected property. `window.__nylo_early_token` is an implementation-specific variable that third-party scripts have no reason to look for.
2. The SDK deletes this variable immediately upon consuming it, further narrowing the exposure window.
3. The token is one-time-use and short-lived, so even if read by another script, it provides minimal value.

The SDK automatically detects whether the early-cleanup script has already processed the token (by checking `window.__nylo_early_token`) and skips redundant URL cleanup.

### 5.3 Opt-In Fallback: URL Search Parameters

Query parameter token transport is **disabled by default**. If hash fragment transport is not feasible (e.g., the destination URL uses hash-based client-side routing that would conflict with the token), the implementation MAY explicitly opt in to search parameter transport:

```
https://destination.com/page?nylo_token=<signed_token>
```

**Opt-in mechanism (reference implementation):**

```html
<script src="nylo.js" data-allow-query-params="true"></script>
```

**Privacy implications of query parameter transport:**

- Query parameters ARE included in HTTP requests to the destination server
- Query parameters ARE logged in server access logs by default
- Query parameters MAY appear in `Referer` headers sent to third parties
- Query parameters ARE visible to network intermediaries

Implementations using search parameter transport MUST:
- Remove the token from the URL immediately after reading it
- Use `history.replaceState()` to clean the URL without a page reload

Implementations using search parameter transport SHOULD:
- Implement server-side log redaction for `nylo_token` and `wai_token` parameters
- Configure `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer` or `Referrer-Policy: same-origin` headers

### 5.4 Parameter Names

Implementations MUST accept both parameter names:
- `nylo_token` (primary)
- `wai_token` (legacy/alternative)

### 5.5 Token Cleanup

Token cleanup operates in two phases:

**Phase 1: Early Cleanup (recommended)**

The inline `<head>` early-cleanup script (Section 5.2) strips the token from the URL hash fragment before any other scripts execute. The token is stashed in `window.__nylo_early_token` for the SDK to consume.

**Phase 2: SDK Cleanup (fallback)**

If the early-cleanup script is not deployed, the SDK MUST remove the token from the URL when it initializes. This cleanup occurs later in the page lifecycle, so a brief visibility window exists between page load and SDK initialization.

After reading the cross-domain token (from either source), the SDK MUST:
- Remove the token from the URL via `history.replaceState()`
- Delete `window.__nylo_early_token` if it was used
- Preserve any non-token hash parameters or search parameters

Token cleanup prevents:
- Accidental sharing of token-bearing URLs
- Token replay from browser history
- Token exposure in analytics tools that capture full URLs

## 6. Token Format and Verification

### 6.1 Token Contents

A cross-domain token encodes:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `waiTag` | The pseudonymous identifier to transfer |
| `sessionId` | The session identifier from the origin domain |
| `userId` | Optional application-level identifier (may constitute personal data if linkable to an individual; requires lawful basis if used) |
| `originDomain` | The domain that issued the token |
| `destinationDomain` | The intended recipient domain |
| `issuedAt` | UTC timestamp of token creation |
| `expiresAt` | UTC timestamp of token expiry |
| `nonce` | Unique per-token identifier for replay protection |
| `signature` | Server-generated HMAC-SHA256 signature |

### 6.2 Verification Requirements

The verification server MUST check:

1. **Signature validity** — The token has not been tampered with
2. **Expiry** — The token has not expired (configurable window, recommended default: 5 minutes)
3. **Replay protection** — The token has not been previously verified. Each token MUST only be accepted once. The server MUST maintain a record of consumed token nonces for at least the token expiry window.
4. **Domain authorization** — The destination domain SHOULD be DNS-authorized to receive identities
5. **Origin matching** — The token SHOULD be validated against the domain making the verification request

**Error codes:**

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `TOKEN_EXPIRED` | Token has passed its expiry timestamp |
| `TOKEN_REPLAYED` | Token has already been verified (replay attempt) |
| `INVALID_SIGNATURE` | HMAC signature verification failed |
| `DOMAIN_NOT_AUTHORIZED` | Destination domain is not DNS-authorized |
| `ORIGIN_MISMATCH` | Token origin does not match the requesting domain's referrer |

### 6.3 Verification Endpoint

```
POST /api/tracking/verify-cross-domain-token
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "token": "<signed_token>",
  "domain": "destination.com",
  "customerId": "<customer_id>",
  "referrer": "https://origin.com/page"
}
```

**Success Response:**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "identity": {
    "sessionId": "<session_id>",
    "waiTag": "<wai_tag>",
    "userId": null
  }
}
```

**Failure Response:**

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "TOKEN_EXPIRED"
}
```

---

## 7. DNS Domain Authorization

### 7.1 Purpose

Before a domain can receive cross-domain identities, it must prove ownership via a DNS TXT record. This prevents unauthorized domains from requesting or receiving WaiTags.

### 7.2 TXT Record Format

```
_nylo-verify.example.com  TXT  "nylo-domain-verify=<verification_code>"
```

### 7.3 Verification Flow

1. Domain owner adds the TXT record to their DNS configuration
2. Domain owner calls the verification endpoint: `POST /api/dns/verify`
3. The server performs a DNS lookup for `_nylo-verify.<domain>`
4. If the TXT record matches the expected verification code, the domain is authorized
5. Authorization is cached server-side and periodically re-verified

### 7.4 Subdomain Inheritance

If `example.com` is DNS-verified, subdomains (`blog.example.com`, `shop.example.com`) inherit authorization automatically. Implementations MAY provide configuration to exclude specific subdomains.

---

## 8. Client-Side Storage

### 8.1 Three-Layer Strategy

The SDK stores identity data locally using three mechanisms for resilience. These storage mechanisms are used exclusively for **local identity persistence** on a single domain — they are never used for cross-domain token transport (which uses URL hash fragments as defined in Section 5).

| Layer | Mechanism | Persistence | ITP Impact |
|-------|-----------|-------------|------------|
| 1 | First-party cookie (`nylo_wai`) | 24 hours (JS-set under ITP) | Capped at 7 days, 24h if JS-set |
| 2 | `localStorage` | Until cleared | Partitioned by eTLD+1 under ITP |
| 3 | `sessionStorage` | Tab lifetime | Unaffected by ITP |

### 8.2 Storage Read Priority

When restoring identity, the SDK reads in order: cookie → localStorage → sessionStorage. The first valid result is used.

### 8.3 Data Stored

```json
{
  "sessionId": "<secure_id>",
  "waiTag": "<wai_tag>",
  "userId": null,
  "domain": "example.com",
  "createdAt": "2026-02-20T12:00:00.000Z",
  "integrity": "<hash>"
}
```

The `integrity` field is a one-way hash of `sessionId + domain + waiTag + customerId`, used to detect tampering.

### 8.4 Obfuscation at Rest

Data stored in `localStorage` is encoded with a customer-specific salt and timestamp to prevent casual inspection. This is obfuscation, not cryptographic security — it prevents trivial reading of identity data via browser developer tools but does not provide protection against a determined attacker with page-level JavaScript access.

## 9. Security Threat Model and Mitigations

### 9.1 Threat Summary

| Threat | Severity | Mitigation | Residual Risk |
|--------|----------|------------|---------------|
| Token interception by destination server | High | Hash fragment transport — tokens are never sent in HTTP requests | None (when using hash transport) |
| Token interception by third-party page scripts | High | Early-cleanup `<head>` script removes token from URL hash before other scripts execute; token stashed in implementation-specific global variable | Low — token accessible via `window.__nylo_early_token` if script knows the variable name; mitigated by one-time-use and short expiry |
| Token interception by browser extensions | Medium | Short expiration + one-time-use verification | Low (see Section 9.3) |
| Token replay | High | One-time-use verification with server-side nonce tracking | None |
| Token tampering | High | HMAC-SHA256 signature verification | None |
| Token expiration bypass | High | Server-side timestamp validation (default 5 minutes) | None |
| Token exposure via URL sharing | Medium | Early-cleanup removes token before page renders + short expiration + one-time-use | Negligible |
| Unauthorized domain participation | High | DNS TXT record verification | None |
| Referrer header leakage | Low | Hash fragments are not included in `Referer` headers per browser spec; `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer` recommended | Negligible |
| Query parameter exposure to servers | High | Query parameter transport is disabled by default; opt-in only | None (when using default hash transport) |
| DNS spoofing of authorization records | Medium | DNSSEC recommended; verification over secure channels | Low |
| Server-side HMAC key compromise | High | Key rotation policies; secure key storage | Organizational |
| Brute-force token verification | Medium | Rate limiting on verification endpoints | None (when rate limiting is deployed) |

### 9.2 Early-Cleanup Script: Defense in Depth

The early-cleanup script (Section 5.2) is the primary defense against token exposure to unauthorized JavaScript. Here is the detailed execution timeline showing what each actor can see at each stage of page load:

```

### 9.3 Browser Extension Limitation: Detailed Analysis

Browser extensions represent the one token interception vector that **cannot be fully mitigated** at the application layer. This section provides a thorough analysis of the threat, its practical severity, and the layered defenses that limit its impact.

#### 9.3.1 Why Extensions Can See the Token

Browser extensions with content script access can declare `"run_at": "document_start"` in their manifest. This tells the browser to inject the extension's content script before the page's own `<head>` scripts execute. At this point, the extension has access to `window.location.hash`, which still contains the token.

The browser's execution order is:

```
1. Browser parses HTML <head>
2. Browser injects content scripts with "run_at": "document_start"  ← Extension sees hash
3. Browser executes inline <head> scripts                           ← Early-cleanup runs
4. Browser continues parsing and executing remaining scripts
```

Step 2 happens before step 3. This is by design — it is how the browser extension model works. No application-layer JavaScript can execute before a `document_start` content script.

#### 9.3.2 Why This Is a Limited Threat

Despite extensions having theoretical access, the practical risk is low for the following reasons:

**1. Extensions must be explicitly installed by the user**

Unlike third-party page scripts (which are loaded by the site operator and run on every visit), browser extensions are software that the user has personally chosen to install. A malicious extension capable of intercepting WTX-1 tokens would need to:
- Be published on the Chrome Web Store, Firefox Add-ons, or equivalent marketplace
- Pass the marketplace's review process
- Be discovered and installed by the target user
- Specifically target WTX-1 tokens (a niche protocol) rather than more valuable targets

An extension with `document_start` content script access and the ability to read `window.location.hash` on all pages already has far more powerful capabilities than intercepting a WTX-1 token — it could read passwords, form data, authentication tokens, and any other page content.

**2. Tokens are one-time-use**

Even if an extension captures the token, it must race to verify it before the Nylo SDK does. The verification server accepts each token exactly once. In practice, the SDK sends the verification request within milliseconds of initialization, leaving an extremely narrow window for an extension to submit the token first.

If the extension does manage to verify the token first, the SDK's verification will fail, and no identity will be restored — the user simply gets a fresh session on the destination domain. No data is compromised.

**3. Tokens expire in 5 minutes**

A captured token that is not immediately verified becomes useless within 5 minutes. The extension cannot store it for later use or transmit it to a remote server for delayed exploitation.

**4. Tokens contain only pseudonymous data**

Even if an extension successfully intercepts and verifies a token, it obtains only:
- A WaiTag (pseudonymous identifier with no PII)
- A session ID (random string)
- An optional application-level user ID
- The origin domain name

None of this data identifies a real person. The extension gains the ability to correlate visits across two domains — which is the same capability that the authorized site operator already has. No new privacy harm is introduced.

**5. The same user installed the extension**

The user whose token is intercepted is the same user who installed the extension. This is fundamentally different from third-party tracking, where a remote party tracks users without their knowledge. If a user installs a malicious extension, they have already granted that extension broad access to their browsing activity — intercepting a WTX-1 token provides negligible additional data.

#### 9.3.3 Comparison to Other Protocols

This limitation is not unique to WTX-1. Every web-based protocol that uses client-side state is subject to extension interception:

| Protocol | Extension Access |
|----------|-----------------|
| OAuth 2.0 redirect tokens | Extensions can read `?code=` from redirect URLs |
| SAML assertions | Extensions can read POST body data |
| JWT in localStorage | Extensions can read `localStorage` |
| Session cookies | Extensions can read `document.cookie` |
| WTX-1 tokens | Extensions can read `window.location.hash` |

WTX-1's one-time-use + short expiry model provides **stronger** protection against extension interception than most of these alternatives, which use long-lived tokens or persistent storage.

#### 9.3.4 What Would Fully Solve This

The only way to fully eliminate extension access to the token would be a **browser-native API** that mediates the token transport:

```
// Hypothetical future browser API
navigator.crossDomainContext.receive()
  .then(token => { /* extension cannot intercept */ });
```

Such an API would allow the browser itself to handle token transport without exposing the token to any JavaScript (page or extension). If WTX-1 gains adoption, this explainer can serve as the basis for proposing such a browser API to the W3C.

Until then, the combination of early-cleanup, one-time-use, short expiration, and the pseudonymous nature of the token data makes extension interception a low-severity residual risk.

### 9.4 HTTPS Requirement

All token transport and verification MUST occur over HTTPS. The protocol MUST NOT be used over unencrypted HTTP. Without TLS, tokens are visible to network intermediaries regardless of hash fragment or query parameter transport.

### 9.5 Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

If the destination page is vulnerable to XSS, an attacker's injected script could read the hash fragment or `window.__nylo_early_token` before the SDK consumes it. Implementations MUST:
- Sanitize all token data before use
- Never insert token values into the DOM without proper escaping
- Follow OWASP XSS prevention guidelines

The early-cleanup script mitigates this partially by reducing the window, but an XSS vulnerability on the destination page undermines all client-side security guarantees, not just WTX-1.

### 9.6 DNS Spoofing

DNS TXT record verification is subject to DNS spoofing attacks. An attacker who can spoof DNS responses could cause the verification server to authorize an unauthorized domain. Implementations SHOULD:
- Use DNSSEC where available
- Validate DNS responses over secure channels (DNS-over-HTTPS or DNS-over-TLS)
- Cache DNS authorization results and re-verify periodically

### 9.7 Server-Side Key Management

The shared HMAC key used for token signing MUST be stored securely on participating servers. Implementations SHOULD:
- Rotate HMAC keys periodically (recommended: every 90 days)
- Support multiple active keys during rotation periods
- Use hardware security modules (HSMs) or key management services where available
- Never log or expose HMAC keys in error messages or debug output

### 9.8 Rate Limiting

Verification endpoints MUST implement rate limiting to prevent:
- Token brute-force attacks (guessing valid tokens)
- Denial-of-service attacks against the verification server
- Nonce table exhaustion from rapid replay attempts

Recommended limits: 100 verification requests per IP per minute, with exponential backoff on failures.

## 10. Privacy Considerations

### 10.1 Pseudonymous Identifiers and GDPR

Under GDPR, pseudonymous identifiers are considered personal data when they can be attributed to a natural person using additional information (Article 4(5)). WaiTags are pseudonymous — they contain no PII, but an organization could theoretically maintain a separate mapping table linking WaiTags to real identities.

WTX-1 does not define or require such a mapping. Implementors who create such mappings take on the full obligations of a GDPR data controller, including lawful basis, data subject rights, and data protection impact assessments.

Implementors SHOULD NOT create WaiTag-to-identity mappings unless they have a clear lawful basis and have completed a DPIA.

### 10.2 Data Minimization

Cross-domain tokens contain only the minimum fields necessary for identity verification. No behavioral data, page content, interaction history, device information, or browsing history is included in the token.

### 10.3 User Control and Consent

Implementations MUST provide:
- **Consent API** — Ability to grant or revoke consent for cross-domain identity
- **Anonymous mode** — When consent is denied, no WaiTag is generated, no tokens are created, and only aggregate anonymous analytics are collected
- **Data clearing** — Ability to clear WaiTag and all associated data
- **Transparency** — Ability to view what data has been collected
- **Deletion** — Ability to request deletion of all data associated with a WaiTag (GDPR Article 17)

### 10.4 Consent-Gated Degradation

When consent is denied:
- No WaiTag is generated or stored
- No cross-domain tokens are created or accepted
- Events are tracked with a random per-session identifier only
- No data persists beyond the current page session
- The SDK operates in a fully anonymous mode with no cross-domain capability

### 10.5 Identifier Rotation

WaiTags stored in `localStorage` persist until explicitly cleared. To limit the window of potential correlation, implementations SHOULD implement rotation policies — for example, regenerating the WaiTag every 90 days. This bounds the maximum duration over which a single pseudonymous identifier can be used to correlate cross-domain visits.

---

## 11. Consent Model

### 11.1 API

```javascript
// Grant consent — enables cross-domain identity
nylo.setConsent({ analytics: true });

// Revoke consent — degrades to anonymous mode
nylo.setConsent({ analytics: false });

// Check current consent state
nylo.getConsent();
// Returns: { analytics: true } or { analytics: false }
```

### 11.2 Default State

The default consent state is implementation-defined. Implementations operating in jurisdictions that require prior consent (e.g., EU under GDPR/ePrivacy) SHOULD default to `analytics: false` and require explicit opt-in. Implementations in jurisdictions that allow opt-out models MAY default to `analytics: true`.

### 11.3 Consent Revocation

When consent is revoked:
1. The WaiTag is deleted from all storage layers
2. The user ID is cleared
3. Cross-domain sync state is reset
4. The SDK switches to anonymous mode
5. No further cross-domain tokens are generated or accepted

## 12. Compatibility

### 12.1 Browser Support

WTX-1 uses standard web APIs available in all modern browsers:
- `crypto.getRandomValues()` (Web Cryptography API)
- `localStorage` / `sessionStorage` (Web Storage API)
- `history.replaceState()` (History API)
- `URLSearchParams` (URL API)
- `fetch()` (Fetch API)

No browser-specific APIs or vendor prefixes are required.

### 12.2 Tracking Prevention Interaction

WTX-1 does not use third-party cookies, third-party storage, redirect-based tracking, or bounce tracking patterns. It should not trigger Safari ITP, Firefox ETP, or Chrome's bounce tracking mitigations. However, this has not been formally verified with all browser vendors, and future tracking prevention heuristics could potentially flag hash-fragment-based token transport.

### 12.3 Hash-Based Routing Compatibility

Single-page applications using hash-based routing (e.g., `#/page/123`) may conflict with hash fragment token transport. In this case, implementations may need to opt in to query parameter transport (Section 5.3) or implement a custom token extraction strategy that operates before the router initializes.

### 12.4 Progressive Adoption

Sites can adopt WTX-1 incrementally:
1. **Single-domain tracking** works without any DNS configuration
2. **Cross-domain identity** activates only when DNS authorization records are configured
3. **Early-cleanup script** can be deployed independently before full SDK integration
